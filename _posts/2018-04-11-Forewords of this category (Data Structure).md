# Forewords of this category (Data Structure)
   This category mainly includes my thoughts and source codes in the duration of my Data Structure's study. In the same time, I'll study another book which names *<Algorithm(4th)>* written by *Robert Sedgewick* and *Kevin Wayne*. And I think it'll be more beneficial if I study these two familiar courses together.
  
  This categories is mainly based on a book which names *<Data Structure(C Edition)>* written by *Weimin Yan* and *Weimin Wu*.This book is well-known as the most authoritative teaching material in Chinese universities. And it's also quite difficult to fully understand.
  
  As a postgraduate entrance examer, I think I'm obliged to study this textbook. And I'll put my source codes on my blog for archival purposes and reference.
  
  All source codes in this category are based on C99(C11 will be noted).IDE: Code::Blocks(17.12)
  
  As I said before, if you find any fault in my codes or if you may have any thought of this book, I'd appreciate it if you could give me some feedback. Any method is welcomed.
