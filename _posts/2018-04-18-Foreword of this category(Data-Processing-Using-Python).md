#Foreword of this category(Data-Processing-Using-Python)
This category mainly includes my thoughts and inspirations while I'm taking a course named  *Data Processing Using Python* in [coursera](www.coursera.org).

Honestly I have never studied python before, thus I'll study from the very beginning, and it'll takes quite long time for me to get familiar with python and do lots of things via python.
As the same as my articles in other categories, I will put my source codes and corresponding questions on my articles, and I will put my thoughts and notes on my blog too.

However, what really different from other categories is **I will write articles in Chinese in this blog.** This is mainly because I can express my thoughts and notes easier and more accurate when I use Chinese. And I think it's better to express more accurate while touching a brand new language.

If you find any fault in this category , and method contacting with me is available and welcomed.
