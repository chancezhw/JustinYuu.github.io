1007 Maximum Subsequence Sum （25 分）

Given a sequence of K integers { N1, N2 , ..., NK}. A continuous subsequence is defined to be { Ni, Ni+1, ..., Nj} where 1≤i≤j≤K. The Maximum Subsequence is the continuous subsequence which has the largest sum of its elements. For example, given sequence { -2, 11, -4, 13, -5, -2 }, its maximum subsequence is { 11, -4, 13 } with the largest sum being 20.

Now you are supposed to find the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence.

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies two lines. The first line contains a positive integer K (≤10000). The second line contains K numbers, separated by a space.
    
## Output Specification:

For each test case, output in one line the largest sum, together with the first and the last numbers of the maximum subsequence. The numbers must be separated by one space, but there must be no extra space at the end of a line. In case that the maximum subsequence is not unique, output the one with the smallest indices i and j (as shown by the sample case). If all the K numbers are negative, then its maximum sum is defined to be 0, and you are supposed to output the first and the last numbers of the whole sequence.

## Sample Input:

    10
    -10 1 2 3 4 -5 -23 3 7 -21
    
## Sample Output:
    
    10 1 4
    
## my own thoughts
  Quite an easy dynamatic programming problem. Use varieble _max_ to store total maximum value,while using varieble _sum_ to store temporary maximum value.  
  Besides,remember that the problem requires printing first/last value but not their indexes. 
  Here are my own codes
  
    {% highlight ruby %}
	#include <iostream>
	#include <cstdio>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
	    int k;
	    int fir=0,las=k-1;
	    int sum=0,max=-1;
	    int tempfir=0;
	    int p[10001];
	    cin>>k;
	    for(int i=0;i<k;++i)
		cin>>p[i];
	    for(int i=0;i<k;++i)
	    {
		sum=sum+p[i];
		if(sum<0)
		{
		    sum=0;
		    tempfir=i+1;
		}
		else if(sum>max)
		{
		    max=sum;
		    fir=tempfir;
		    las=i;
		}
	    }
	    if(max>=0)
		cout<<max<<' '<<p[fir]<<' '<<p[las];
	    else
		cout<<0<<' '<<p[0]<<' '<<p[k-1];
	    return 0;
	}
	{% endhighlight %}

## reflection

Havn't found any method to improve. Possibily cause it's a quite easy dynamic programming:).

  If you find there are faults in the source codes, any method connecting with me is welcomed.
