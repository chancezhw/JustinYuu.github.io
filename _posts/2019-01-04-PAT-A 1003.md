PAT-A 1003

1003 Emergency （25 分）

As an emergency rescue team leader of a city, you are given a special map of your country. The map shows several scattered cities connected by some roads. Amount of rescue teams in each city and the length of each road between any pair of cities are marked on the map. When there is an emergency call to you from some other city, your job is to lead your men to the place as quickly as possible, and at the mean time, call up as many hands on the way as possible.

## Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. For each test case, the first line contains 4 positive integers:N(<=500)- the number of cities (and the cities are numbered from 0 to N-1),M- the number of roads, C1 and C2 - the cities that you are currently in and that you must save, respectively. The next line contains N integers, where the i-th integer is the number of rescue teams in the i-th city. Then M lines follow, each describes a road with three integers c1,c2 and L, which are the pair of cities connected by a road and the length of that road, respectively. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one path from C1 to C2. 
    
## Output Specification:
For each test case, print in one line two numbers: the number of different shortest paths between C1 and C2, and the maximum amount of rescue teams you can possibly gather. All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there is no extra space allowed at the end of a line.

## Sample Input:

    5 6 0 2
    1 2 1 5 3
    0 1 1
    0 2 2
    0 3 1
    1 2 1
    2 4 1
    3 4 1
    
## Sample Output:
    
    2 4
    
## my own thoughts
  Method to solve this problem is Dijsktra Algorithm, and a few adjustments are needed too.  
  To solve this problem,we need to figure out not only all the shortest pathes,but also their weight in total.Thus what we need is to build a new array _num[]_ and let it store the number of shortest pathes,while another array _rescue[]_ is responsible to store the weight of each nodes and we can calculate the total weight through this array. 
  Here is the core codes in this algorithm
  
  	{%highlight ruby%}
	for(int j=0;j<G.vexnum;++j)
		if(G.edges[k][j]!=INF&&!visited[j])
		{
		if(dist[j]>dist[k]+G.edges[k][j])
		{
			dist[j]=dist[k]+G.edges[k][j];
			w[j]=w[k]+rescue[j];
			num[j]=num[k];
		}
		else if(dist[j]==dist[k]+G.edges[k][j])
		{
			if(w[k]+rescue[j]>w[j])
			w[j]=w[k]+rescue[j];
			num[j]+=num[k];
		}
		}
	}
	{% endhighlight %}
The purpose of those codes is to find the shortest path and upgrade array num[] and w[](which is to store total weight) instantly.When the shortest path is found,the distance and the weight and the number will be found _toghther_.

## reflection
Dijkstra Algorithm is so crucial that is needed to be firmly kept in mind.And this algorithm is capble in many problems in the graph fields. However,we need to upgrade many arrays as array dist[] changes,which is quite complex and easy to make mistakes,thus in order to simplify it,we can store all the shortest path(not distance),and we choose the best path among them or make some statistic works. For example, in this problem, we can cal the numbers and the weight after we store all shortest pathes.So as to other similiar problems.  
As for the details, we can use DFS to find all possible path,and choose the best one by the second scale.In this problem,the second scale is the rescue numbers,which is the weight of the vertex node.Besides, it is also acceptable if we need to cal the weight of the arcnode.  
Here are the codes(ver 2.0):

	{%highlight ruby%}

	vector<int> pre[MaxSize];
	int rescue[MaxSize]={0};
	int num=0;
	int weight=0;
	vector<int> temppath;
	void DFS(int v,int c1)
	{
	    if(v==c1)

		    value+=rescue[id];
		}

		    weight=value;

	    }
	    temppath.push_back(v);
	    for(int i=0;i<pre[v].size();++i)

	    temppath.pop_back();
	}
	int main()
	{

besides,there are still ways to improve,such as Bellman-Ford Algorithm. The prove of BF Algo won't be presented here cause it's not our goal here to prove it, what we only need is to use it and finish this problem.Bellman-Ford has a tremendous advantage,which is can be used to solve problem of graph with negative weight.However,we even don't use this function here.Anyway, I put codes as below.
	
	{%highlight ruby%}
	#include <iostream>
	#include <cstring>
	#include <cstdio>
	#include <vector>
	#include <set>
	#include <algorithm>

	#define INF 10000000
	struct Node
	{
		int v,dis;
		Node(int _v,int _dis):v(_v),dis(_dis){}
	};
	vector<Node> Adj[MAXV];
	int n,m,st,ed,weight[MAXV];
	int d[MAXV],w[MAXV],num[MAXV];
	set<int> pre[MAXV];

	void Bellman(int s)
	{

						num[v]=num[u];

					{
						if(w[u]+weight[v]>w[v])
							w[v]=w[u]+weight[v];
					pre[v].insert(u);
					num[v]=0;
					set<int>::iterator it;
					for(it= pre[v].begin();it!=pre[v].end();it++)
						num[v]+=num[*it];
					}
				}
	}
	int main()
	{
		scanf("%d%d%d%d",&n,&m,&st,&ed);

Actually Bellman-Ford Algorithm have a relatively bad time complexity,which is O(VE).Thus an optimizing is needed.Actually,only when d[u] got to change can its neighbor d[v] have the possibility to change. Thus there is no need to opreate every single arcnode each round. Instead,we can use a queue to optimize it. That's what SPFA(Shortest Path Faster Algorithm) comes about.  

To be honest,I can hardly understand so many algorithms once a time,thus I will learn and put these optimizing method on my blog gradually. I think being able to understand Dijkstra and it's DFS optimizing,along with Bellman-Ford in a day is quite enough:)  

I would like to give my quite insignificant thanks to _HuFan_,who is the main writer of the book _Algorithm Notebook_. I use codes and thoughts from that book for reference and it does help me a lot.I never thought before that one problem could link so much algorithms and relative knowledges together. I fell into it and started to program from 8:00 pm to 2:00 am and I don't feel exhausted or tired at all.Maybe that's the charm of programming and I feel felicity to study what I am really fond of.
