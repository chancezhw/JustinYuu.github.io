This poem is my favourite poem written by Dylan Thomas,it reminds me that never feel fulfilled when having accomplished something and never feel frustrated when encoutering failure.

Do not go gentle into that good night

 Dylan Thomas

Do not go gentle into that good night.
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lighting they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men,the last wave by,crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage,rage against th dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn,too late,they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men,near death,who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage,rage against the dying of the light.

And you,my father,there on the sad height,
Curse,bless me now with your fierce tears,I pray
Do not go gentle into that good night
Rage,rage against the dying of the light.
