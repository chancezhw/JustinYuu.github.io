# My blog

This blog uses Jekyll Theme Simple Texture created by Yizeng <http://yizeng.me/blog>  
And the link of this theme is here:<https://yizeng.github.io/jekyll-theme-simple-texture/>  

All articles posted here are all written by myself. I divide them into various tags depending on the language they use and different catagories depending on their subjects, which makes us easier to read and search.  

My website is bound with a domain name <https://justin-yu.me>,which is shorter and easier to memorize.

My blog supports live comments supported by [disqus](https://disqus.com). Any acceptable comment is welcomed if you are so kind to be willing to communicate with me.
